# Fitness Monitor v1.0 Requirements

_Note: The Fitness Monitor v1.0 was originally developed as an ENCE361 project. This is a slightly edited summary of the requirements that were provided to the class._

1. The Fitness Monitor should estimate the number of steps taken by a user

   - Step estimation can be based on data from the accelerometer on the Orbit board.

2. The Fitness Monitor should estimate the distance travelled by the user

3. The Fitness Monitor should allow the user to set a step goal and should display progress towards this goal

4. The Fitness Monitor should notify the user when a goal is completed

5. The Fitness Monitor should allow the user to reset the device state, clearing any stored data

6. The Fitness Monitor user interface – made up of the display, buttons, switches and potentiometer on the TIVA and Orbit boards – should function according to the specification given in the [UI Specification](v1-ui-spec.md).

7. The Fitness Monitor should include a "test mode", which should function according to the specification given in the [UI Specification](v1-ui-spec.md)

8. The Fitness Monitor software should use an interrupt-driven kernel

9. The Fitness Monitor software should maintain robust behaviour at all times
